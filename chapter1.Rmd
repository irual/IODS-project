### Feelings and expectations

How am I feeling? Currently I'm a bit exhausted with all the technical challenges I had with Git and Rstudio integration with several computers. After installing brand new Linux system things were going better though.  

So the course started with  

* problems  
* troubles  
* challenges

...but from this on I'm expecting

* easiness
* joy
* wisdom.  

I expect to learn R and Git integration, _and already did_. Looking forward to hear ideas for some **data analysis**: I have experience with another software and R packages as well, but with R it's sometimes difficult to see which packages and tehchiques are used and recommended.  

I heard about this course when Kimmo was advertising it via Statnet mailing list.  

### R calculations...  

```{r}
1+1
0/0
```
### ...and inline code.  

Square of two equals `r sqrt(2)`.
